sbt-doge
========

:bangbang: **This plugin is retired.** sbt-doge has been merged in sbt 1. See [#18](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-doge/issues/18). :bangbang:

sbt-doge is a sbt plugin to aggregate across `crossScalaVersions` for multi-project builds, which I call partial cross building.

![sbt-doge](sbt-doge.png?raw=true)

Current implementation of `+` cross building operator does not take in account for the `crossScalaVersions` of the sub projects. Until that's fixed, here's an alternative implementation of it.

setup
-----

This is an auto plugin, so you need sbt 0.13.5+. Put this in `project/doge.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-doge" % "0.1.5")
```

usage
-----

First, define a multi-project build with a root project aggregating some child projects:

```scala
def commonSettings: Seq[Def.Setting[_]] = Seq(
  organization := "com.example.doge",
  version := "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
)

lazy val rootProj = (project in file(".")).
  aggregate(libProj, fooPlugin).
  settings(commonSettings: _*)

lazy val libProj = (project in file("lib")).
  settings(commonSettings: _*).
  settings(
    name := "foo-lib",
    scalaVersion := "2.11.1",
    crossScalaVersions := Seq("2.11.1", "2.10.4")
  )

lazy val fooPlugin =(project in file("sbt-foo")).
  dependsOn(libProj).
  settings(commonSettings: _*).
  settings(
    name := "sbt-foo",
    sbtPlugin := true,
    scalaVersion := "2.10.4",
    crossScalaVersions := Seq("2.10.4")
  )
```

Next run this from the root project:

```scala
> ;so clean; such test; very publishLocal
```

sbt-doge will break the above into the following commands and executes them:

```scala
> wow 2.11.1
> libProj/clean
> wow 2.10.4
> libProj/clean
> fooPlugin/clean
> wow 2.10.4
> wow 2.11.1
> libProj/test
> wow 2.10.4
> libProj/test
> fooPlugin/test
> wow 2.10.4
> wow 2.11.1
> libProj/publishLocal
> wow 2.10.4
> libProj/publishLocal
> fooPlugin/publishLocal
> wow 2.10.4
```

It is looking into `aggregate` of the current project, and for each aggregated project, running a loop for each `crossScalaVersions` and executing the passed in command. The currently supported prefixes are: `much`, `so`, `such`, and `very`.

`wow` is a better implementation of `++` that only affects the aggregated projects.

## CrossPerProjectPlugin

`CrossPerProjectPlugin` overrides sbt's `+` and `++` commands and uses doge's implementation that aggregates command respecting `crossScalaVersions` at each subproject. It is not a triggered plugin and so must be enabled using `enablePlugins(CrossPerProjectPlugin)`.

can now be written as

    > ;+ clean; + test; + publishLocal

## strict aggregation

sbt-doge adds strict aggregation command `plz`. `plz 2.11.5 compile` will aggregate only the subproject that contains `2.11.5` in `crossScalaVersions`. The alias for `plz` command is `+++` for `CrossPerProjectPlugin`.

## Usage from sbt-release

sbt-doge can be used with the [sbt-release](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-release) plugin for the purposes of cross publishing as of sbt-release 1.0.4 onward. To use it you will want to ensure that `releaseCrossBuild` is set to `false`, and that your release steps incorporate certain `+` commands (see note below). Here is an example that substitues the regular test and publish steps with their cross build equivalents:

**NOTE**: the `+` command here assumes `CrossPerProjectPlugin` is enabled - if it is not either enable it or change the `+` to `so` or equivalent.

      releaseCrossBuild := false
      releaseProcess := Seq[ReleaseStep](
        checkSnapshotDependencies,
        inquireVersions,
        runClean,
        releaseStepCommandAndRemaining("+test"),
        setReleaseVersion,
        commitReleaseVersion,
        tagRelease,
        releaseStepCommandAndRemaining("+publish"),
        setNextVersion,
        commitNextVersion,
        pushChanges
      )

You will also need to ensure that any sub project that is used as a classpath dependency of another sub project i.e. referenced in a `dependsOn`, is also aggregated.

The [ConductR Library](https://github.com/typesafehub/conductr-lib) project incorporates the above settings in order to deliver a complex build for Scala 2.11 and Scala 2.12. Certain sub projects are excluded from Scala 2.12 concerns as there will not be any support for them e.g. when considering Play 2.3 and Play 2.4. The resultant artifacts are signed and published to Maven Central.
